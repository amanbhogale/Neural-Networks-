# Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository contains a comprehensive learning framework for building neural networks from the ground up. The goal is to provide a deep understanding of neural networks by developing them from scratch, without relying on popular frameworks like PyTorch or NumPy. This approach allows for a deeper grasp of the underlying mathematical concepts and mechanics behind neural networks.

## Key Features

- **Building Neural Networks Without Frameworks**: Start from the basics by constructing neural networks without the aid of any deep learning libraries. This includes manually implementing forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and loss calculations.

- **Mathematical Intuition**: Gain a solid foundation in the mathematics that underpins neural networks. This includes topics such as the Universal Approximation Theorem, gradient descent optimization, and error analysis.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Explore the structure and function of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers in CNNs. Understand how CNNs work with image data and how they can be built from scratch.

- **Pre-building Mathematics**: Delve into the essential mathematical concepts that are necessary for understanding and building neural networks. This includes linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory, which are crucial for the approximation theorem and other advanced topics.
